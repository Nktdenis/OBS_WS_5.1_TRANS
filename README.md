control of two instances of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) through WebSocket.

The main functions of the program include:

1) Easy connection and disconnection to two OBS instances with specified IP address and port.
2) Real-time monitoring of recording and broadcasting statuses for each OBS instance.
3) Management of scenes in both OBS instances, including the ability to switch between scenes.
4) Capability to start and stop recording simultaneously in both instances.
5) Capability to start and stop broadcasting simultaneously in both instances.
6) Display of current time, delayed time, and countdown timer for scheduling delayed broadcasts.
7) Assignment of event names with time settings for timers.

  To use the program, it is necessary to pre-install and configure two instances
of Open Broadcaster Software with WebSocket support activated.
